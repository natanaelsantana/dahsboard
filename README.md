# Dashboard project from The Odin Project 
In this project I learned how to use grid and flexbox
I confess i had some difficults in grid in the beggining, but after a time i take the ideia!
Weel, It's pretty simple dashboard, and different from i have imagined, but i'm proud of that!

ps: I didn't make responsive yet, but for sure i will come back and do something better!
